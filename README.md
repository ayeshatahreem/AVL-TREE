# AVL-TREE
 C++ code for AVL-TREE class in which Tree node will store the Height of node along with data. 
 
  Empty Tree Height:    -1  
  Leaf Node Height:    0 
1. AVL-insert function which is modification of the "insert" function of BST class so that the tree remains always balanced by using the AVL rotations. Time complexity must be O (log N).  
2. AVL-print function by changing the ascending order print function of BST. AVL-print should print the height of each node along with data.
